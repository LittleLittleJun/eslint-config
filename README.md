## Eslint config file

Eslint is a linter used in sublime text to highlight any style or syntax errors you specify in code. It's a pretty helpful tool for maintaining a consistent and easy to read style, if you are interested read more [here](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint).

CLI version of Eslint is found [here](http://eslint.org/).

If you are new to sublime plugins or package control read more about them [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

### Setup

Download the .eslintrc.js file and place it in ~/ directory, or in the base directory of your project. Tweak values are per your personal style, go to the [Eslint rules docs](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) for more info on what each rule does.

#### Extra Plugins
Here is a list of other sublime text plugins I use.

[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) will let you install any of a huge number of packages made specifically for sublime. Some of the packages I use are:

[Git](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-git-inside-of-sublime-text-to-improve-workflow): gives you the ability to use git commands from sublime, super useful.

[SublimeCodeIntel](https://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/SublimeCodeIntel): gives the user a powerful code intellisense and autocomplete in sublime.

[Emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime): use css-like shorthand to create HTML incredibly fast, also provides tons of amazing keyboard shortcuts to improve productivity. Click [here](http://emmet.io/) to get to the Emmet homepage.

[Sublime Linter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/): Sublime’s base linter, eslint requires this to work. Used to maintain code quality while writing the code itself.

[Eslint](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint): the most powerful Javascript linter I have personally used. Takes a little setup out of the box, creating the main config file(I’m going to send you mine so you are good to go) but it allows for the best customizability I’ve seen out of any linter.

[HTML5](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/HTML5): adds HTML5 syntax mode and snippets to sublime.

[SideBarEnhancements](https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements): makes the side bar on sublime much more powerful, get to do a lot of things you normally wouldn’t
